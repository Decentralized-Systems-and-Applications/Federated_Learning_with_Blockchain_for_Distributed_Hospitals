# 🏥 Federated Learning with Blockchain for Distributed Hospitals

## 🔍 Overview
This project develops a **blockchain-based federated learning framework** that enables hospitals to collaboratively train AI models **without sharing patient data**.  
It ensures **privacy 🔒, transparency 📊, trust 🤝, and auditability 🧾** in medical AI collaboration.

---

## 💡 Motivation
Healthcare institutions face strict privacy regulations, resulting in **data silos**.  
**Federated Learning** allows hospitals to train models locally, while **Blockchain** guarantees secure and verifiable coordination.

> *Bring the AI to the data — not the data to the AI.*

---

## 🧪 Current Project Status
At this stage, a **single-hospital local training pipeline** has been implemented and validated.

### ✅ Implemented Features
- 🧠 Local ML model trained on hospital data  
- 🩺 Disease prediction based on patient symptoms only  
- 🔢 Model outputs **only a disease code**  
- 📚 Medical details (name, treatment, contagious & chronic status) retrieved from a **lookup table**  
- 🏥 Dataset split into **three simulated hospital datasets** to prepare for federated learning  

This forms a solid foundation for distributed training.

---

## 🚀 Next Phase
- 🌐 Distributed federated training across hospitals  
- 🔄 Model aggregation and update sharing  
- 🔗 Blockchain-based tracking of model updates  
- 📦 Smart contracts and IPFS integration
